\title{Label a plate with sample and probe information}
\usage{
label_plate_rowcol(plate, rowkey = NULL, colkey = NULL, coercefactors = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{plate}{tibble (data frame) with variables WellR, WellC, Well. This
would usually be produced by create_blank_plate(). It is possible to
include other information in additional variables.}

\item{rowkey}{tibble (data frame) describing plate rows, with variables WellR
and others.}

\item{colkey}{tibble (data frame) describing plate columns, with variables
WellC and others.}

\item{coercefactors}{if TRUE, coerce WellR in rowkey and WellC in colkey to factors}
}
\value{
tibble (data frame) with variables WellR, WellC, Well, and others. 
  
  This tibble contains all combinations of WellR and WellC found in the input
  plate, and all information supplied in rowkey and colkey distributed across
  every well of the plate. Return plate is ordered by row WellR then column
  WellC.
  
  Note this ordering may cause a problem if WellC is supplied as a character
  (1,10,11,...), instead of a factor or integer (1,2,3,...). For this reason,
  the function by default converts WellR in `rowkey`, and WellC in `colkey`,
  to factors, taking factor levels from `plate`, and warns the user.
  
  Other tidyqpcr functions require plate plans to contain variables SampleID,
  TargetID, and Type, so `label_plate_rowcol` will warn if any of these are
  missing. This is a warning, not an error, because these variables can be
  added by users later.
