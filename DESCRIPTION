Description: This package is for reproducible quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis using packages from the tidyverse, notably dplyr and ggplot2. It normalizes (by ddCt), summarizes, and plots pre-calculated Ct data, and plots raw amplification and melt curves from Roche lightcycler machines. It does NOT (yet) calculate Ct data from amplification curves.
